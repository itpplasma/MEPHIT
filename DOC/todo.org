* use $B_{0 \phi}$ where possible in documentation because \texttt{bphicovar} is assumed constant
* use modulo for indices in matrix assembly (instead of copy&paste for one special case) [done]
* rewrite to use assemble_system without mass matrix [done]
* documenting variables in Doxygen with LaTeX syntax
* modify grid illustration [done]
* initialize oldknot to last knot â†’ no special treatment for periodic boundary conditions [done]
* determinant: any isnan, overflow check, SuiteSparse function; condition number [redo]
* reading input files from experiment
- ASDEX Upgrade has two formats that are common: CLISTE and EFIT/EQDSK (g-files)
- much data in /proj/plasma/RMP/DATA/ASDEX/ and /proj/plasma/RMP/DATA2017/ASDEX/
* check weighting factors (R, S, l, ...) of vector DOFs [done]
* replace nkpol when handling sparse matrices (along with alternative meshing)
- in compute_presn handle x and size(x) as in compute_currn
* consistent I/O of intermediate results [done]
* documentation
- [ ] barycentric coordinates for ring_avg_coord
- [ ] example matrices for aver_quad
- [ ] linear interpolation error
- [ ] analytical solution
* check divergence at LCFS
- d, du and individual factors are smooth, x and q are not
