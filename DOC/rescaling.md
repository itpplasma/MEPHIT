# Large aspect ratio limit

In codes that approximate a torus by a periodic cylinder one makes the transformation
$$
\begin{align}
R &= R_0 + r\cos\vartheta, \\
\varphi &= z/R_0\\
Z &= r\sin\vartheta.
\end{align}
$$
One works in wavenumbers $k_z =R_0 n​$ rather than toroidal harmonics $n​$. In the limit of large aspect ratios $r/R_0​$ we can set $R\approx R_0​$ in many places. In that case physical components $B_{(\varphi)}=R B^{\varphi}=B_{\varphi}/R​$ conincide with $B_{(z)}=B_z=B^z​$.

## Stretched torus

Now we are going to construct a stretched torus that takes not a single periodic cylinder, but $\gamma$ periods to construct a torus. In that case we have


$$
\begin{align}
\bar{R} &= \gamma R_0 + r\cos\vartheta, \\
\bar{\varphi} &= z/(\gamma R_0),\\
\bar{Z} &= r\sin\vartheta.
\end{align}
$$
Wavenumbers are  $k_z =\gamma R_0 \bar n$  compared to harmonics $\bar n$ in $\bar \varphi$. We maintain $B_{(\bar \varphi)} = \bar{R} B^{\varphi} = B_{(z)}$, i.e. set the same physical components.
