\section{Preprocessing of Input Data}
\label{sec:inputs}

To provide the necessary input data to the iteration steps, the following steps are taken in order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Field line integration of the equilibrium magnetic field $\vec{B}_{0}$ yields $(R, Z)$ coordinates of points of constant $\psi$ with high resolution, i.e., flux surfaces.
\item From these, a coarser, but still field-aligned grid is derived, with indexing described in \cref{sec:grid-impl}. Most computations are performed on the triangles constructed from this grid.
\item Flux surface quantities are interpolated on this grid, but note the details on equilibrium pressure $p_{0}$ in \cref{sec:pres0}, toroidal equilibrium current $\vec{J}_{0}^{\tor}$ in \cref{sec:j0phi}, and the safety factor $q$ in \cref{sec:safety_factor}.
\item The vacuum perturbation field $\Bvac$ is calculated from the external coil currents $I_{\text{c}}$ by the \textsc{Biot}--\textsc{Savart} law (\cref{eq:biot-savart}) on a regular grid in $(R, \phi, Z)$ coordinates. For a given toroidal mode number $n$, $\vec{B}_{n}$ is then projected onto triangle edges, yielding $\Psi$ for a representation by \textsc{Raviart}--\textsc{Thomas} elements.
\end{enumerate}

The equilibrium quantities are assumed to be available in GEQDSK format, shortly summarized by \textcite{Lao97}. It consists of $\psi$ data points given on a rectangular $(R, Z)$ grid, as well as \emph{profiles} of flux surface quantities given for equidistant values of $\psi$. These data points derive from measurements fitted to the \textsc{Grad}--\textsc{Shafranov} equation. Builiding on already existing code, we import such a GEQDSK file and generate a field-aligned grid as described in \cref{sec:grid} and specified in \cref{sec:grid-impl}. Values of $\vec{B}_{0}^{\pol}$ and its partial derivatives on arbitrary $(R, Z)$ coordinates are supplied by interpolation with quintic splines in $R$ and $Z$ based on \cref{eq:B0R,eq:B0Z}. Flux surface quantities are interpolated by fourth-order \textsc{Lagrange} polynomials, which includes the calculation of $\vec{B}_{0}^{\tor}$ from $F(\psi)$ (see \cref{eq:F}).

In the implementation of NEO-EQ, the necessary values of $\vec{B}_{0}$ on edge midpoints and shifted centroids are cached once before calculations start as to avoid repeated function calls to spline interpolation and possibly allow for other data sources. The values of flux surface quantities on the computational grid are also cached, i.e., there is one value \emph{on} each flux surface, referred to as \emph{full-grid} value, and one value \emph{between} flux surfaces, referred to as \emph{half-grid} value.

\subsection{Grid Indexing}
\label{sec:grid-impl}

Necessary information regarding any grid include the coordinates of grid points, the numbering of grid points and triangles including edge adjacency list. Since our grid is field-aligned, there are a few conventions to be considered compared to more arbitrary grids. The code has to \enquote{find its way}, so we make assumptions on numbering.

The number of flux surfaces realized on the grid is known and referred to as \nflux. The numbers increase going outward from the magnetic axis, which is \emph{not} included and thus gets the index 0. Full-grid quantities use the same indexing scheme, whereas for half-grid quantities, the index refers to the outer or enclosing flux surface and starts at 1.

Node numbering starts from 1 at the magnetic axis, increasing towards the separatrix. Then, the nodes on the enclosing flux surface (index 1) are enumerated counter-clockwise, starting with the node lying on the line connecting the magnetic axis and the X point. Then the next enclosing flux surface (index 2) is enumerated, and so on. This way, a simple bijection between \enquote{global} node numbering and the \enquote{local} numbering on a specific flux surface can be implemented. The flux surface indexing is the same as for full-grid quantities, and the number of nodes per flux surface needs to be known. \Cref{fig:numbering_nodes} illustrates global node numbering.

Triangle numbering operates on similar assumptions, albeit with flux surface indexing akin to half-grid quantities. The innermost triangle strip (index 1) is enumerated first, starting at index 1 for the triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 3. It also goes counter-clockwise, and on each flux surface it starts with the triangle whose edge \inw\ lies on the line between the magnetic axis and the X point, i.e., it follows node numbering. Again, local numbering on a triangle strip can be converted to global numbering when the number of triangles is known. \Cref{fig:numbering_triangles} illustrates global triangle numbering.

  \label{fig:numbering_scheme}
\end{figure}

Associated with each triangle are local indices, i.e., 1 to 3, for nodes and edges. The global node number is saved for each local node number. The edges do not have a global index, and they are numbered in a fashion that edge 1 connects node 1 to 2, edge 2 connects node 2 to 3, and edge 3 connects node 3 to 1. When the index of node \vfs\ is known and the aforementioned conventions are followed, we can map the symbolic designations \fs, \inw, \out\ to the local edge index, \vfs, \vinw, \vout\ to the local (and global) node index and edge vectors $\vec{l}$ can be given in counter-clockwise direction. Furthermore, an adjacency list is constructed, giving any triangle's neighbor on a given edge and the local edge number in the neighboring triangle.

Scalar quantities like $p_{n}$ are indexed by global node number and vector quantities like $\vec{B}_{n}$ and $\vec{J}_{n}$ are indexed by global triangle number and local edge number. The latter convention involves some redundancy as it takes twice the storage that would be necessary, but it also allows for consistency checks and more straightforward implementation.

\subsection{Alternative Pressure Profiles}
\label{sec:pres0}

While the equilibrium pressure $p_{0}$ should be available from the GEQDSK file and the equilibrium current $\vec{J}_{0}$ can be computed from the equilibrium field via Ampère's law as in \cref{eq:ampere-gen}, another approach is possible. Since we have never used Ampère's law for equilibrium quantities, it is possible to choose a pressure profile and calculate $J_0^{\phi}$ to be consistent with the MHD equilibrium in \cref{eq:mhd-gen}. The latter is the \textsc{Pfirsch}--\textsc{Schlüter} current and its calculation is outlined in \cref{sec:j0phi}. The simplest approach to the pressure profile assumes a linear profile for the particle density $n$ and temperature $T$,
\begin{align}
  n^{(k)} &= n_{\text{edge}} + \frac{\psi^{(k)} - \psi_{\text{edge}}}{\psi_{\text{axis}} - \psi_{\text{edge}}} (n_{\text{axis}} - n_{\text{edge}}), \label{eq:dens} \\
  T^{(k)} &= T_{\text{edge}} + \frac{\psi^{(k)} - \psi_{\text{edge}}}{\psi_{\text{axis}} - \psi_{\text{edge}}} (T_{\text{axis}} - T_{\text{edge}}), \label{eq:temp}
\end{align}
where $k$ refers to the index of the flux surface. The subscripts \enquote{edge} and \enquote{axis} indicate the value at the plasma edge and the magnetic axis, respectively. The configurable values are then $n_{\text{axis}}$ and $T_{\text{axis}}$ as well as $n_{\text{edge}}$ and $T_{\text{edge}}$. From these, the pressure is calculated by the ideal gas law:
\begin{gather}
  p_{0} = n k_{\text{B}} T. \label{eq:pres0}
\end{gather}
Additionally, with the formulae given above, one can also derive an expression for the equilibrium pressure gradient:
\begin{gather}
  p_{0}' (\psi) = n' (\psi) k_{\text{B}} T + n k_{\text{B}} T' (\psi) = \frac{(n_{\text{axis}} - n_{\text{edge}}) k_{\text{B}} T + n k_{\text{B}} (T_{\text{axis}} - T_{\text{edge}})}{\psi_{\text{axis}} - \psi_{\text{edge}}}.
\end{gather}

\subsection{Toroidal Equilibrium Current}
\label{sec:j0phi}

Since $\vec{B}_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ are directly available as input data, but $\vec{J}_{0}$ is not, it may be computed by Ampère's law:
\begin{gather}
  J_{0 (\phi)} = \frac{c_{0}}{4 \pi} \left ( \pd[B_{0}^{R}]{Z} - \pd[B_{0}^{Z}]{R} \right ).
\end{gather}
This reduces to the second derivative of a spline in $\psi$, which may result in unacceptable amplification of any noise present in the input data. One solution to this problem is to smooth out input data by averaging over a given number of neighbouring data points. Alternatively, the toroidal equilibrium current may be recovered from the solution of the \textsc{Grad}--\textsc{Shafranov} equation, the necessary data being contained in the GEQDSK file. \textcite{Lao97} includes the corresponding formula, but note that compared to e.g. \textcite{Freidberg14}, a factor of $\mu_{0}$ is missing in the denominator of the second term on the right-hand side. The relation in Gaussian units is given by
\begin{gather}
  J_{0 (\phi)} = c_{0} R p_{0}'(\psi) + \frac{c_{0}}{4 \pi R} F F'(\psi).
\end{gather}
Furthermore, the \textsc{Pfirsch}--\textsc{Schlüter} current will be derived below just from $\vec{B}_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ via \cref{eq:mhd-gen}, the condition of divergence-freeness, and symmetry considerations.

We take a cross-product of \cref{eq:mhd-gen} by $\vec{B}_{0}$:
\begin{align}
  \vec{B}_{0} \times \left( \vec{J}_{0} \times \vec{B}_{0} \right) &= B_{0}^{2} \vec{J}_{0} - (\vec{B}_{0} \cdot \vec{J}_{0}) \vec{B}_{0} \nonumber \\
  &= B_{0}^{2} (\vec{J}_{0} - J_{0}^{\parallel} \vec{h}_{0}) \nonumber \\
  &= B_{0}^{2} \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp}.
\end{align}
Therefore
\begin{gather}
  \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp} = \frac{-c \grad p_{0} \times \vec{B}_{0}}{B_{0}^{2}},
\end{gather}
which is the diamagnetic current density. For the parallel current density we use
\begin{align}
 0 = \divg \vec{J}_{0} &= \divg \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp} + \divg (J_{0}^{\parallel} \vec{h}_{0}) \nonumber \\
 &= -c \divg \frac{\grad p_{0} \times \vec{B}_{0}}{B_{0}^{2}} + \vec{B}_{0} \cdot \grad \frac{J_{0}^{\parallel}}{B_{0}}.
\end{align}
In symmetry flux coordinates $(\rho, \phi, \theta)$ with associated Jacobian $\sqrt{g}$, outlined in \cref{sec:cocos}, the divergence of the diamagnetic current is
\begin{align}
  \divg \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp} &= -\frac{c}{\sqrt{g}} \pd{u^{k}} \left[ \frac{\sqrt{g}}{B_{0}^{2}} \left( \grad p_{0} \times \vec{B}_{0} \right)^{k} \right] \nonumber \\
  &= -\frac{c}{\sqrt{g}} \pd{u^{k}} \left( \frac{\sqrt{g}}{B_{0}^{2}} \frac{\varepsilon^{ijk}}{\sqrt{g}} \pd[p_{0}]{u^{i}} B_{0 j} \right) \nonumber \\
  &= -\frac{c p_{0}' (\rho) B_{0 \phi}}{\sqrt{g}} \pd{\theta} \frac{1}{B_{0}^{2}},
\end{align}
since $p_{0}$ and $B_{0 \phi}$ are constant on a flux surface, $\pd[p_{0}]{\theta} = 0$, and due to axisymmetry, $\pd{\phi} = 0$ for equilibrium quantities. The divergence of the parallel current is
\begin{gather}
  \divg(J_{0}^{\parallel} \vec{h}_{0}) = \vec{B}_{0} \cdot \grad \frac{J_{0}^{\parallel}}{B_{0}} = B_{0}^{\theta} \pd{\theta} \frac{J_{0}^{\parallel}}{B_{0}}.
\end{gather}
With $\sqrt{g} B_{0}^{\theta} = \psi'(\rho) = -1$ as a flux surface quantity, there are no dependencies of $\theta$ in front of the derivatives:
\begin{gather}
  -c p_{0}' (\rho) B_{0 \phi} \pd{\theta} \frac{1}{B_{0}^{2}} + \psi'(\rho) \pd{\theta} \frac{J_{0}^{\parallel}}{B_{0}} = 0.
\end{gather}
Direct integration and a change of variables and notation as in
\begin{gather}
  \frac{p_{0}'(\rho)}{\psi'(\rho)} = \frac{\pd[p_{0}]{\rho}}{\pd[\psi]{\rho}} = \pd[p_{0}]{\psi} = p_{0}'(\psi)
\end{gather}
yields
\begin{gather}
  \frac{-c p_{0}' (\psi) B_{0 \phi}}{B_{0}^{2}} + \frac{J_{0}^{\parallel}}{B_{0}} = C(\psi). \label{eq:j0parallel_general}
\end{gather}
With the extra condition of the flux surface average\footnote{See \cref{eq:flux_surface_avg}, but note that it is not actually evaluated here.} $\left\langle J_{0}^{\parallel} B_{0} \right\rangle = 0$ for testing without bootstrap and inductive current, we obtain
\begin{gather}
  -c p_{0}'(\psi) B_{0 \phi} = C(\psi) \left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle.
\end{gather}
In general, 
\begin{gather}
  C(\psi) = -\frac{c p_{0}'(\psi) B_{0 \phi}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi),
\end{gather}
with $D(\psi)$ set to 1 for now and modified for the more general case $\left\langle J_{0}^{\parallel} B_{0} \right\rangle \not\equiv 0$. Inserting this back into \cref{eq:j0parallel_general} yields
\begin{gather}
  J_{0}^{\parallel} = \frac{c p_{0}'(\psi) B_{0 \phi}}{B_{0}} \left( 1 - \frac{B_{0}^{2}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi) \right).
\end{gather}

For the unperturbed toroidal current density, we have
\begin{gather}
  J_{0}^{\phi} = J_{0}^{\parallel} h_{0}^{\phi} + \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp} \cdot \grad \phi,
\end{gather}
where
\begin{align}
  J_{0}^{\parallel} h_{0}^{\phi} &= \frac{c p_{0}'(\psi) B_{0 \phi}}{B_{0}} \frac{B_{0}^{\phi}}{B_{0}} \left( 1 - \frac{B_{0}^{2}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi) \right) \nonumber \\
  &= c p_{0}'(\psi) \frac{\left( B_{0}^{\tor} \right)^{2}}{B_0^2} \left( 1 - \frac{B_{0}^{2}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi) \right) \nonumber \\
  &= c p_{0}'(\psi) \left( B_{0}^{\tor} \right)^{2} \left( \frac{1}{B_{0}^{2}} - \frac{D(\psi)}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} \right).
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
  \vec{J}_{0}^{\perp} \cdot \grad \phi &= \frac{-c p_{0}'(\psi) \grad \phi \cdot (\grad \psi \times \vec{B}_{0})}{B_{0}^{2}} \nonumber \\
  &= \frac{-c p_{0}'(\psi) \vec{B}_{0} \cdot (\grad \phi \times \grad \psi)}{B_{0}^{2}} \\
  &= \frac{c p_{0}'(\psi)}{B_{0}^{2}} \vec{B}_{0}^{\pol} \cdot \vec{B}_{0} \nonumber \\
  &= c p_{0}'(\psi) \frac{\left( B_{0}^{\pol} \right)^{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}.
\end{align}
It follows that
\begin{gather}
  J_{0}^{\phi} = c p_{0}'(\psi) \left( \frac{\left( B_{0}^{\pol} \right)^{2} + \left( B_{0}^{\tor} \right)^{2}}{B_{0}^{2}} - \frac{\left( B_{0}^{\tor} \right)^{2}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi)\right) = c p_{0}'(\psi) \left( 1 - \frac{\left( B_{0}^{\tor} \right)^{2}}{\left\langle B_{0}^{2} \right\rangle} D(\psi)\right).
\end{gather}

\subsection{Safety Factor}
\label{sec:safety_factor}

Instead of using the safety factor stored in a given GEQDSK file, it can be computed from \cref{eq:q_field_line_pitch}, but this requires the calculation of $\theta$ coordinate lines from $\vec{B}_{0}$. A simple approximation follows from an equivalent definition in \textcite{dHaeseleer91}, involving the toroidal flux $\psi_{\tor}$ which in our choice of coordinates is given by
\begin{gather}
  \psi_{\tor} = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \int \diff V \, \vec{B}_{0} \cdot \grad \phi = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int \diff R \, \diff Z \, R B_{0}^{\phi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int \diff R \, \diff Z \, B_{0 (\phi)}.
\end{gather}
Note that $\psi_{\tor} < 0$ and $\psi_{\tor}' (\rho) < 0$. The safety factor is then given by
\begin{gather}
  q = \frac{\psi_{\tor}' (\rho)}{\psi_{\pol}' (\rho)} = \frac{-\psi_{\tor}' (\psi)}{-\psi_{\pol}' (\psi)} = \td[\psi_{\tor}]{\psi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \td{\psi} \int \diff R \, \diff Z \, B_{0 (\phi)}.
\end{gather}
This flux quantity can be evaluated numerically at half-grid positions\footnote{Full-grid values are then interpolated via \textsc{Lagrange} polynomials as usual.} by adding up $B_{0 (\phi)}$ inside the volume between two flux surfaces and dividing by the the difference in $\psi$:
\begin{gather}
  q \approx \frac{1}{2 \pi \symup{\Delta} \psi} \sum_{k} B_{0 (\phi)} (\Omega^{(k)}) S_{\Omega^{(k)}}, \label{eq:q-impl}
\end{gather}
where the sum is taken over all triangles $\Omega$ inside a triangle strip, and $S_{\Omega}$ is the respective triangle surface area. Note that both $B_{0 (\phi)}$ and $\symup{\Delta} \psi$ are negative, so $q$ is positive overall.
